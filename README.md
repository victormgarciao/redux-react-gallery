# REACT GALLERY

- This is an application which fetch Gifs from the famous site Giphy throw its own API.
- We will see a gallery with some of the most popular Gifs
- We can load more Gifs just pressing at the button `More Gifs!!!`
- We can select an image, and we will see the image in its original size
    - Also you will be able to go to the next or previous one when it's possible
    - You can close the Single Image View by pressing the close button with the big X
- We have used these technologies:
    - React
    - Redux
    - Sagas
    - Webpack
    - Jest
    - Styled-Component
    - Styled-System
- We are loading some images behind the scenes (Asynchronuous load) so the user load is faster
- Documentation:
    - Each piece of this project is documented
    - To see all the documentation you only have to browse to the folders of the application and you will find a readme with related information
    - Some examples
        - https://github.com/victormgarciao/redux-react-gallery/tree/master/src/reducers
        - https://github.com/victormgarciao/redux-react-gallery/tree/master/src/components/atoms/Button
        - https://github.com/victormgarciao/redux-react-gallery/tree/master/src/containers
        - https://github.com/victormgarciao/redux-react-gallery/tree/master/src/sagas/Images
- Tests
    - There are some tests
        - App.test.js
        - src/reducers/images.reducer.test.js
    - Room for improvement: MUCH, MUCH, MUCH Tests, but for the purpose of the project, maybe it's enough so far

And now, lets keep original documentation in orden to get some info about the scripts

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
