### Containers

- On this project containers will have the logic of the component
- Some logic comes from HOCs, another from custom props
- We organize with atomic design
  - atoms: It only has dumb components and we pass logic throw them
  - molecules: It has one or many atoms containers
  - organisms: It has one or many molecules container (No need for this project)
